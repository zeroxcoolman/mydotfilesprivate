# Setup & Updates

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/snowarch/inir.git
cd inir
./setup install
```

Add `-y` for non-interactive mode.

## Update

```bash
./setup update
```

What happens:
1. Checks remote for new commits
2. Creates snapshot (for rollback)
3. Pulls changes
4. Syncs QML code, scripts, assets
5. Syncs Vesktop themes (if present)
6. Applies required migrations automatically
7. Offers optional migrations
8. Restarts shell
9. Checks for missing system packages
10. Updates Python venv packages

Your user configs (`config.json`, `config.kdl`) are never touched.

## Doctor

```bash
./setup doctor
```

Diagnoses and **automatically fixes** common issues:
- Missing directories
- Script permissions
- Python packages (via uv)
- Version tracking
- File manifest
- Starts shell if not running

## Rollback

```bash
./setup rollback
```

Restore a previous snapshot if something breaks after an update. Shows available snapshots with dates and lets you choose which one to restore.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `./setup` | Interactive menu |
| `./setup install` | Full installation |
| `./setup update` | Check remote, pull, sync, restart |
| `./setup doctor` | Diagnose and auto-fix |
| `./setup rollback` | Restore previous snapshot |

Options: `-y` (skip prompts), `-q` (quiet), `-h` (help)

## What Gets Installed

| Source | Destination |
|--------|-------------|
| QML code | `~/.config/quickshell/ii/` |
| Niri config | `~/.config/niri/config.kdl` |
| ii config | `~/.config/illogical-impulse/config.json` |
| GTK/Qt themes | `~/.config/gtk-*/`, `~/.config/kdeglobals` |

On first install, existing configs are backed up. On updates, your configs are never touched - only QML code is synced.

## Migrations

Some features need config changes (new keybinds, layer rules, etc). After `update`, you're asked if you want to apply pending migrations. Each shows exactly what will change, with automatic backup.

## Backups

- Install backups: `~/inir-backup/`
- Update backups: `~/.local/state/quickshell/backups/`

## Uninstall

```bash
# Stop ii from starting
# Comment out in ~/.config/niri/config.kdl:
# spawn-at-startup "qs" "-c" "ii"

# Remove configs
rm -rf ~/.config/quickshell/ii
rm -rf ~/.config/illogical-impulse
```
