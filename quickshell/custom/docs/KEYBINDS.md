# Default Keybinds

These are the default keybinds shipped with ii. They live in `~/.config/niri/config.kdl` after install.

Change them. Break them. Make them yours. We won't judge.

## Customizing

Edit `~/.config/niri/config.kdl` to change keybinds. See [IPC.md](IPC.md) for all available ii targets you can bind.

Example (because you're definitely going to ask):

```kdl
binds {
    // Your custom binds
    Super+P { spawn "qs" "-c" "ii" "ipc" "call" "session" "toggle"; }
}
```

Then reload Niri so it actually notices:

```bash
niri msg action load-config-file
```

If your keybind doesn't work, you probably forgot to reload. Don't worry, we've all been there.
